Purpose:
this is designed to be a news distributing server only. It fetches RSS feeds

Running:
    twistd -noy rss_server.py
This code depends on
- rss.py from http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/277099
- feedparser.py from http://diveintomark.org/projects/feed_parser/
- twisted python (python is less fun without)
