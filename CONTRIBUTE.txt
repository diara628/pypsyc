    Should you wish to contribute to this program, you can receive a
    write access to the software repository from symlynX. By checking
    code in, you grant us permission to license your contribution under
    both the GNU General Public License and under other licenses.

    With the act of checking into the software repository, you guarantee
    that you are either the author and copyright owner of the contribution
    you are making, or that you have a license to use said contribution in
    a way compatible with our terms of use. If you fail to do so, you
    remain the sole responsible for your acting; no part of the
    responsibility will be transferred to symlynX.

    This means, for example, that you cannot contribute code elements
    which stem from an other GPL project, as this would not comply with
    the dual licensing requirement described above.



... if you don't like these terms, feel free to start your own repository ...
    or maybe just talk with us about it?
