pyPSYC depends on python (tested with 2.2.1) and tkinter
(note: if you want you can write qt, gtk, wxpython gui's etc)
also, this version depends on twisted python from twistedmatrix.com

prior to starting you need to edit the config-example file and move it
to $HOME/.pypsyc/config

on windows keep it in the same directory as chat_client.py and change
line 22
  config.read(os.getenv("HOME") + "/.pypsyc/config")
to
  config.read("config")
This will soon be automated somehow. 
start pyPSYC with `python chat_client.py`

there are two command styles... local command which start with "/"
currently there are two of them, "/join psyc://host/@room"
(atm this works only if you are connected to host)
and "/part" which parts the current room.
/quit is also supported, although atm it is semantically an alias for #quit

the other command style is commands starting with "#"
they are handled by your UNI with a _request_execute
